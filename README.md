 My book of spells

## As a "Modern-day Wizard" most Software Engineers have a repo of common tasks they perform
I've taken to calling this my "book of spells"

### Ansible
Primarily used for provisioning instances with pre-installed software

### Bash
Hacking the box all the time:
I currently use bash to simplify tasks I normally perform on a regular basis

### Java
Most of my Java experience is related to Hadoop MapReduce; however, my projects were in support of Federal Systems, which I am duty bound to not disclose

### Packer
Packer has been my niche for the last two years
Whether you want it in JSON or HCL (Hashicorp Configuration Language) I've got you covered

### Terraform
Provisioning instances for the cloud (usually coupled with Images created with Packer and Ansible)
